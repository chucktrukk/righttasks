* Use the default Google Tasks widget, that can be activated in Gmail without the extension from the Mail dropdown menu on the top left. The extension now triggers the Tasks widget automatically and positions it as a column on the right.
* The new behaviour fixes a number of issues, and you are now able to properly add e-mails as tasks using the standard SHIFT + T shortcut.


### 1.0 (March 10, 2013)

* Initial Chrome extension release, using the Google Tasks iframe used by most extensions/widgets

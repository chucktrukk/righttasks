RightTasks is a browser extension that puts your Google Tasks in a sidebar in Gmail, like in Google Calendar.

This is especially useful if you keep Gmail open and want to see your tasks at all times.

You can use all the features available in the official tasks widget, such as:
* "Create a task based on the open message", which you can use from the "More > Add to Tasks" menu or with the "SHIFT + T" keyboard shortcut while viewing an email
* The "G then K" keyboard shortcut, which shifts the cursor from Gmail to Tasks.


Development
-----------

* To run the extension in Chrome, load the `/extension` folder as an unpacked extension.

* To run the extension in Firefox, install the [Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation), then run `cfx run` in the `/extension` folder.
